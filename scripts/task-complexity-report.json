      "complexityScore": 10,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the ingestion engine setup into subtasks for: (1) source type handler architecture, (2) job queue design and scaling, (3) configuration hot-reload system, (4) manual review UI and workflow, (5) document visibility management, (6) database schema changes, (7) integration and end-to-end testing, and (8) deployment/monitoring setup.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing a highly modular, configurable ingestion system with multiple source types, asynchronous job management, hot-reloadable configuration, manual curation, and visibility controls. It spans backend, frontend, and database layers, requiring robust testing and integration. The breadth and depth of requirements, plus the need for extensibility and reliability, make this a highly complex (10/10) task that should be decomposed into at least 8 focused subtasks."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the enrichment pipeline into subtasks for: (1) provider abstraction and integration, (2) failover and health monitoring, (3) prompt versioning and auditability, (4) cost tracking and reporting, (5) hybrid processing architecture, (6) schema versioning and validation, and (7) comprehensive testing and CI integration.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires integrating multiple LLM providers with failover, cost tracking, prompt versioning, and hybrid processing. It demands careful abstraction, error handling, and cost management, as well as robust schema and test coverage. The complexity is high due to the need for reliability, extensibility, and operational transparency, warranting at least 7 subtasks."

      "reasoning": "This task covers advanced database schema design, vector search, deduplication, feedback integration, access controls, ORM mapping, caching, and migration planning. Each area is non-trivial and critical for system integrity and performance, justifying a high complexity score and at least 8 subtasks."

      "reasoning": "Building a high-performance RAG API with hybrid search, caching, tracing, and permission enforcement is complex, especially with strict latency requirements. The task spans backend architecture, search algorithms, security, and performance engineering, meriting a complexity of 8 and at least 7 subtasks."

      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating cost tracking, quality metrics, dashboards, tracing, and alerting across a distributed system. While each component is well-understood, their integration and the need for reliability and real-time insights increase complexity, suggesting at least 7 subtasks."

      "reasoning": "This task is primarily frontend-focused but requires robust backend workflow logic, audit trails, and bulk operations. While less complex than core backend or distributed systems, it still involves multiple moving parts and integration points, warranting 6 subtasks."
