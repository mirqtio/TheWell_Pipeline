# TheWell Pipeline - Docker Deployment Summary

## Work Completed

### 1. Database Issues Fixed
- Created `init-database.sql` to ensure all PostgreSQL extensions are properly installed
- Updated both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.production.yml` to include proper database initialization
- Fixed database user and schema issues in test setup
- Created comprehensive `.env.production` file with all required environment variables

### 2. E2E Test Issues Addressed
- Created `app-server.js` to provide full Express app with all routes for testing
- Fixed route mismatches between tests and actual implementation
- Renamed Playwright test to avoid Jest conflicts
- Updated test database configuration to use correct credentials
- Documented remaining test issues that need redesign (curation workflow)

### 3. Docker Desktop Deployment
- Updated Docker Compose configurations for proper service initialization order
- Created deployment script `scripts/deploy-docker.sh` for easy deployment
- Added health checks to all services
- Configured proper networking between services
- Created `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md` with comprehensive deployment instructions

### 4. Codebase Cleanup
- Removed all temporary test artifacts:
  - `.jest-cache-e2e` directories
  - `test-results`, `test-artifacts` directories
  - Trace files (`*.trace`, `*.network`, `*.stacks`)
  - HTML reports and resources
  - Temporary markdown context files
- Updated `.dockerignore` to exclude test artifacts from Docker builds
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent test artifacts from being committed
- Removed all `.DS_Store` files

## Ready for Production Deployment

The application is now ready to run in Docker Desktop with:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-docker.sh
```

## Key Services

- **API**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:3000/api-docs
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001 (monitoring dashboards)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090 (metrics)

## Configuration Required

Before running, update `.env.production` with:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Anthropic API key
- `JWT_SECRET` - A secure random string
- `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Password for Grafana admin user

## Data Persistence

All data is persisted in Docker volumes:
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis cache
- Grafana dashboards
- Prometheus metrics
- Application logs

## Next Steps

1. Configure your API keys in `.env.production`
2. Run `./scripts/deploy-docker.sh`
3. Access the API at http://localhost:3000
4. Monitor the system via Grafana at http://localhost:3001
