# Task ID: 4
# Title: RAG API Development
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a high-performance RAG API with sub-2-second response time, hybrid search capabilities, and intelligent caching.
# Details:
Implement a RAG API service with the following components:

1. Express.js API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express');
   const swaggerDocument = require('./swagger.json');
   
   const app = express();
   app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));
   
   // Search endpoint with tracing
   app.post('/api/v1/rag/search', async (req, res) => {
     const traceId = req.headers['x-trace-id'] || generateTraceId();
     const span = tracer.startSpan('rag_search', { traceId });
     
     try {
       // Cache check
       const cacheKey = generateCacheKey(req.body, req.auth);
       const cachedResult = await redis.get(cacheKey);
       
       if (cachedResult) {
         span.addEvent('cache_hit');
         return res.json(JSON.parse(cachedResult));
       }
       
       // Execute search
       const result = await executeHybridSearch(req.body, req.auth);
       
       // Cache result
       if (shouldCache(req.body, result)) {
         const ttl = calculateCacheTTL(req.body, result);
         await redis.setex(cacheKey, ttl, JSON.stringify(result));
       }
       
       return res.json(result);
     } catch (error) {
       span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR });
       span.recordException(error);
       return res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
     } finally {
       span.end();
     }
   });
   ```

2. Hybrid search implementation:
   - Vector similarity search with pgvector
