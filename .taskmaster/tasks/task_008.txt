     --color-background-dark: #0A0A0A;        /* Near black, not pure black */
     --color-surface-dark: #1A1A1A;           /* Card backgrounds */
     --color-surface-raised-dark: #2A2A2A;    /* Elevated elements */
     
     /* Spacing System */
     --spacing-xs: 4px;   /* Tight groupings */
     --spacing-sm: 8px;   /* Related elements */
     --spacing-md: 16px;  /* Standard gaps */
     --spacing-lg: 24px;  /* Section breaks */
     --spacing-xl: 32px;  /* Major divisions */
     --spacing-xxl: 48px; /* Page sections */
     
     /* Elevation System */
     --elevation-0: none;
     --elevation-1: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06);
     --elevation-2: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);
     --elevation-3: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);
     --elevation-4: 0 15px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 5px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);
     
     /* Animation System */
     --animation-fade-in: fadeIn 200ms ease-out;
     --animation-fade-out: fadeIn 150ms ease-in reverse;
     --animation-slide-up: slideUp 250ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
     --animation-slide-down: slideUp 200ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) reverse;
     --animation-scale-in: scaleGrow 200ms cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);
     --animation-scale-out: scaleGrow 150ms ease-in reverse;
   }
   ```

2. Component library implementation:
   - Button component with all states and variants
   - Card component with elevation and hover states
   - Form fields with validation states
   - Modal and dialog components
   - Navigation components

3. Animation system implementation:
   - Core animation primitives (fade, slide, scale, pulse, number roll)
   - Physics-based transitions
   - Loading state animations
   - Error state animations

4. Responsive layout system:
   - Grid system based on 8-point spacing
   - Breakpoint system for different device sizes
   - Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement

5. Dark mode implementation:
   - Theme switching mechanism
   - Dark mode specific tokens
   - Smooth transition between themes

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual regression tests for all components
2. Accessibility tests for color contrast and keyboard navigation
3. Responsive design tests across breakpoints
4. Animation performance tests
5. Theme switching tests
6. Cross-browser compatibility tests
7. Component prop validation tests
8. Storybook documentation for all components
9. Browser-based e2e tests for component interactions
10. CI verification through GitHub logs via MCP or CLI

# Subtasks:
## 1. Token System Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement a scalable token system for colors, typography, spacing, and other design primitives to ensure consistency and theme support across the design system.
### Details:
Establish a centralized set of design tokens (variables) for core visual properties. Ensure tokens are accessible to both designers and developers, and support multiple themes (e.g., light/dark). Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for token definitions and usage, 2) Create integration tests for token application, 3) Implement e2e tests for token-based styling, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 2. Component Library Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build a reusable component library using the established token system, ensuring accessibility, consistency, and theme adaptability.
### Details:
Develop core UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.) that consume design tokens. Document usage guidelines and ensure components are accessible and responsive. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for component functionality, 2) Create browser-based integration tests for component interactions, 3) Implement e2e tests for component usage in applications, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 3. Animation Primitives Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create and integrate animation primitives for transitions, feedback, and micro-interactions within the component library.
### Details:
Define standard animation tokens (easing, duration) and implement reusable animation utilities. Apply these primitives to components for consistent motion design. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for animation utilities, 2) Create browser-based integration tests for animation behaviors, 3) Implement e2e tests for animation interactions, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 4. Responsive Layout System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Establish a responsive layout system that leverages design tokens and supports adaptive UI across devices and breakpoints.
### Details:
Define grid, spacing, and breakpoint tokens. Implement layout utilities and ensure all components adapt fluidly to different screen sizes. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for layout utilities, 2) Create browser-based integration tests for responsive behaviors, 3) Implement e2e tests for layout adaptability across devices, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 5. Dark Mode Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Implement dark mode support across the design system, ensuring seamless theme switching and accessibility compliance.
### Details:
Extend the token system to include dark mode values. Update components to respond to theme changes and test for color contrast and usability. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for theme switching logic, 2) Create browser-based integration tests for theme application, 3) Implement e2e tests for theme switching interactions, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.
