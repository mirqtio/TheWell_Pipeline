# Task ID: 9
# Title: Admin Dashboard Development
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 5, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build a comprehensive admin dashboard for system monitoring, configuration management, and operational control.
# Details:
Create an admin dashboard with the following components:

1. Dashboard layout implementation:
   - Sidebar navigation with collapsible sections
   - Header with user info and global actions
   - Main content area with responsive grid

2. Ingestion monitoring view:
   - Source type cards with real-time status
   - Activity feed with recent ingestion events
   - Configuration editor with syntax highlighting

3. Enrichment pipeline view:
   - Provider status cards (OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - Flow diagram visualization of the enrichment pipeline
   - Prompt version control interface
   - Cost ticker with real-time spending

4. Knowledge explorer view:
   - Interactive graph visualization of entities and relationships
   - Search interface with filters
   - Document preview with enrichment details

5. Monitoring dashboards:
   - Cost analysis with breakdown by dimension
   - Quality metrics visualization
   - System health monitoring
   - Performance metrics tracking

6. User management:
   - Role-based access control
   - User creation and permission management
   - Audit logs for admin actions

# Test Strategy:
1. Component integration tests
2. Dashboard navigation tests
3. Data visualization accuracy tests
4. Real-time update tests
5. Configuration editor functionality tests
6. User permission enforcement tests
7. Performance tests with large datasets
8. Usability tests with admin users
9. Browser-based e2e tests for dashboard interactions
10. CI verification through GitHub logs via MCP or CLI

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Dashboard Layout [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the overall structure and layout of the admin dashboard with appropriate navigation and component placement
### Details:
Design a hierarchical layout that accommodates all required views (monitoring, pipeline, knowledge explorer, user management). Use decomposition tree visualization to effectively organize complex data relationships. Implement color-coding for different sections and ensure responsive design. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for layout components, 2) Create browser-based integration tests for layout responsiveness, 3) Implement e2e tests for navigation and layout interactions, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 2. Develop Ingestion Monitoring Component [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a real-time monitoring view for data ingestion processes
### Details:
Implement metrics visualization for ingestion rates, errors, and processing times. Include expandable/collapsible nodes to drill down into specific ingestion pipelines. Add progress indicators and status alerts for ongoing processes. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for monitoring components, 2) Create browser-based integration tests for data visualization, 3) Implement e2e tests for monitoring interactions, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 3. Build Enrichment Pipeline Visualization [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop an interactive view of the enrichment pipeline showing data flow and processing stages
### Details:
Create a flowchart-like structure showing data transformation stages. Implement color-coded nodes to indicate pipeline health. Design interactive elements to expand pipeline components for detailed metrics and configuration options. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for visualization components, 2) Create browser-based integration tests for interactive elements, 3) Implement e2e tests for pipeline visualization workflows, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 4. Implement Knowledge Explorer Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build a hierarchical data exploration tool for knowledge base content
### Details:
Develop a decomposition tree visualization that breaks down knowledge content by categories and subcategories. Include search functionality, filtering options, and interactive node expansion. Add percentage indicators and progress bars to show content distribution. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for explorer components, 2) Create browser-based integration tests for search and filtering, 3) Implement e2e tests for knowledge exploration workflows, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 5. Create Monitoring Dashboards [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Develop comprehensive system monitoring views with key performance indicators
### Details:
Design charts and visualizations for system health, performance metrics, and usage statistics. Implement real-time data updates and historical trend analysis. Add alerting mechanisms for critical thresholds and anomaly detection. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for dashboard components, 2) Create browser-based integration tests for data visualization, 3) Implement e2e tests for monitoring workflows, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 6. Develop User Management Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create tools for managing user accounts, permissions, and activity
### Details:
Build user listing with filtering and search capabilities. Implement role and permission management interfaces. Create user activity logs and audit trails with decomposition visualization to analyze user behavior patterns. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for user management components, 2) Create browser-based integration tests for permission controls, 3) Implement e2e tests for user management workflows, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.
