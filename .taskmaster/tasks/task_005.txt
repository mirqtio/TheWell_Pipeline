       this.costRates = {
         openai: {
           'gpt-4-turbo': { input: 0.01, output: 0.03 },
           'gpt-3.5-turbo': { input: 0.0005, output: 0.0015 }
         },
         anthropic: {
           'claude-3-sonnet': { input: 0.003, output: 0.015 },
           'claude-3-haiku': { input: 0.00025, output: 0.00125 }
         }
       };
     }
     
     async trackCostEvent(event) {
       // Calculate costs
       const inputCost = (event.inputTokens / 1000) * this.getCostRate(event.provider, event.model, 'input');
       const outputCost = (event.outputTokens / 1000) * this.getCostRate(event.provider, event.model, 'output');
       const totalCost = inputCost + outputCost;
       
       // Write to time-series database
       await this.influxClient.writePoint({
         measurement: 'pipeline_costs',
         tags: {
           source_type: event.sourceType,
           operation: event.operation,
           provider: event.provider
         },
         fields: {
           input_cost: inputCost,
           output_cost: outputCost,
           total_cost: totalCost,
           input_tokens: event.inputTokens,
           output_tokens: event.outputTokens
         },
         timestamp: event.timestamp
       });
       
       // Check budget limits
       await this.checkBudgetLimits(event, totalCost);
     }
     
     // Additional methods...
   }
   ```

2. Quality monitoring system:
   - Automated quality checks for enriched documents
   - Statistical baselines with anomaly detection
   - Manual QA sampling interface

3. Grafana + Prometheus monitoring stack:
   - System health dashboards
   - Cost tracking dashboards
   - Quality metrics visualization

4. Jaeger distributed tracing:
   - Request-level tracing
   - Performance bottleneck identification

5. Alerting system:
   - Cost threshold alerts
   - Quality degradation alerts
   - System health alerts

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for cost calculation accuracy
2. Integration tests for metrics collection
3. Dashboard functionality tests
4. Alert triggering tests with simulated threshold breaches
5. Performance impact tests to ensure minimal overhead
6. Tracing completeness tests
7. Quality metric calculation tests
8. Budget control tests with simulated cost events
9. Browser-based tests for dashboard interactions
10. CI verification through GitHub logs via MCP or CLI
