## Execution Tracking Template

### Daily Standup Questions
1. What was completed yesterday?
2. What will be worked on today?
3. Are there any blockers?
4. Is system coherence maintained?

### Weekly Review Questions  
1. Features delivered vs. planned?
2. Test coverage trends?
3. Performance metrics?
4. Technical debt introduced?
5. Team velocity accurate?

### Risk Register
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Performance regression | Medium | High | Daily performance tests |
| API breaking changes | Low | High | Contract testing |
| Feature conflicts | Medium | Medium | Feature flags |
| Timeline slippage | Medium | Medium | Buffer time included |

### Coherence Checklist (Run Daily)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No performance regression
- [ ] API compatibility maintained  
- [ ] Feature flags consistent
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
