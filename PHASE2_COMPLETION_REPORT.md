- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexes and query optimization
- **Connection Pooling**: Reused connections for better performance

### Security
- **RBAC Integration**: All endpoints protected with permission checks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all user inputs
- **Audit Logging**: All operations tracked for compliance

## Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "@extractus/article-extractor": "^8.0.0",
  "chart.js": "^4.4.0",
  "canvas": "^2.11.2",
  "exceljs": "^4.4.0",
