# Task ID: 7
# Title: Feedback Loop Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a bidirectional feedback system that captures insights from downstream applications and updates the knowledge base accordingly.
# Details:
Create a feedback integration system with the following components:

1. Feedback API endpoints:
   ```javascript
   // Submit feedback from downstream apps
   app.post('/api/v1/feedback/submit', async (req, res) => {
     const { documentId, appId, feedbackType, content, userId, sessionId } = req.body;
     
     // Validate request
     if (!documentId || !appId || !feedbackType || !content) {
       return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' });
     }
     
     // Store feedback
     const feedback = await db.feedback.create({
       documentId,
       appId,
       feedbackType,
       content,
       userId,
       sessionId,
       createdAt: new Date()
     });
     
     // Trigger immediate processing for high-priority feedback
     if (isHighPriority(feedbackType, content)) {
       await processFeedbackItem(feedback.id);
     }
     
     return res.json({ success: true, feedbackId: feedback.id });
   });
   ```

2. Feedback processor implementation:
   - Periodic batch processing of feedback
   - Aggregation of signals by document
   - Believability score updates based on feedback

3. Feedback types handling:
   - Quality ratings processing
   - Annotation integration
   - Chat log analysis for engagement metrics

4. Improvement suggestion system:
   - Extract corrections from annotations
   - Identify missing information
   - Create enrichment improvement tasks

5. Trending topic detection:
   - Analyze feedback patterns across documents
   - Identify emerging topics of interest
   - Boost relevance for trending content

# Test Strategy:
1. API endpoint tests with various feedback types
2. Feedback processing logic tests
3. Integration tests for believability score updates
4. Performance tests for batch processing
5. Trend detection algorithm tests
6. Security tests for feedback submission
7. End-to-end tests tracing feedback to knowledge base updates
8. Regression tests to ensure feedback doesn't corrupt existing data
9. Browser-based e2e tests for feedback submission and processing
10. CI verification through GitHub logs via MCP or CLI

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Feedback API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop RESTful API endpoints to receive, validate, and store feedback from users, supporting multiple feedback types (e.g., bug reports, suggestions, ratings).
### Details:
Endpoints should handle authentication, input validation, and error handling. Ensure extensibility for future feedback types. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for API endpoints and validation logic, 2) Create integration tests for API interactions, 3) Implement e2e tests for complete feedback submission workflows, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 2. Develop Feedback Processor [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a processing module to handle incoming feedback, supporting both real-time and batch processing modes.
### Details:
Processor should normalize, categorize, and route feedback to appropriate downstream systems or storage. Include logging and monitoring. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for processor logic and routing, 2) Create integration tests for processing workflows, 3) Implement e2e tests for complete feedback processing, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 3. Implement Feedback Type Handling Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Build logic to distinguish and process different feedback types, enabling tailored workflows and prioritization.
### Details:
Support extensible feedback type schemas and ensure each type triggers the correct processing and storage logic. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for type-specific handling logic, 2) Create integration tests for different feedback types, 3) Implement e2e tests for type-specific workflows, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 4. Develop Improvement Suggestion System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Design a system to analyze processed feedback and generate actionable improvement suggestions for the product or knowledge base.
### Details:
Leverage analytics and possibly machine learning to identify patterns and recommend enhancements based on feedback trends. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for suggestion generation algorithms, 2) Create integration tests for suggestion workflows, 3) Implement e2e tests for complete suggestion lifecycles, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 5. Implement Trending Topic Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Create a module to detect trending topics or recurring issues from aggregated feedback data.
### Details:
Use statistical analysis or NLP techniques to surface high-frequency topics and emerging concerns in near real-time. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for trend detection algorithms, 2) Create integration tests with sample feedback data, 3) Implement e2e tests for trend detection workflows, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.

## 6. Conduct Integration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Perform comprehensive integration testing to ensure all feedback components (API, processor, type handling, suggestion system, trend detection) work seamlessly together.
### Details:
Test end-to-end feedback flow, error handling, data consistency, and system performance under various scenarios. Testing requirements: 1) Write unit tests for integration points, 2) Create integration tests for component interactions, 3) Implement browser-based e2e tests for complete feedback system, 4) Run all tests and resolve any issues, 5) Merge to master and verify CI passes via GitHub logs.
