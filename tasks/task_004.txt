# Task ID: 4
# Title: RAG API Development
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a high-performance RAG API with sub-2-second response time, hybrid search capabilities, and intelligent caching.
# Details:
Implement a RAG API service with the following components:

1. Express.js API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express');
   const swaggerDocument = require('./swagger.json');
   
   const app = express();
   app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));
   
   // Search endpoint with tracing
   app.post('/api/v1/rag/search', async (req, res) => {
     const traceId = req.headers['x-trace-id'] || generateTraceId();
     const span = tracer.startSpan('rag_search', { traceId });
     
     try {
       // Cache check
       const cacheKey = generateCacheKey(req.body, req.auth);
       const cachedResult = await redis.get(cacheKey);
       
       if (cachedResult) {
         span.addEvent('cache_hit');
         return res.json(JSON.parse(cachedResult));
       }
       
       // Execute search
       const result = await executeHybridSearch(req.body, req.auth);
       
       // Cache result
       if (shouldCache(req.body, result)) {
         const ttl = calculateCacheTTL(req.body, result);
         await redis.setex(cacheKey, ttl, JSON.stringify(result));
       }
       
       return res.json(result);
     } catch (error) {
       span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR });
       span.recordException(error);
       return res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
     } finally {
       span.end();
     }
   });
   ```

2. Hybrid search implementation:
   - Vector similarity search with pgvector
   - Keyword search with PostgreSQL full-text search
   - Result fusion with reciprocal rank fusion

3. Redis caching strategy:
   - Cache key generation based on query and permissions
   - TTL calculation based on query popularity and content volatility
   - Intelligent invalidation on document updates

4. Request tracing with unique IDs:
   - Distributed tracing across components
   - Performance monitoring for each processing step

5. Visibility-aware querying with permission enforcement

# Test Strategy:
1. Performance tests to verify sub-2-second response time
2. Load tests with concurrent requests
3. Cache effectiveness tests
4. Security tests for visibility enforcement
5. Integration tests for hybrid search accuracy
6. Tracing verification across system components
7. Error handling tests for various failure scenarios
8. API contract tests with OpenAPI validation
9. Browser-based e2e tests for API interactions
10. CI verification through GitHub logs via MCP or CLI
